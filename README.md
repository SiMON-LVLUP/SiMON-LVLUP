- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon, an entrepreneur in the mountain biking field ! I own a MTB school all over the province of Quebec in Canada, and I also own a jump park for bikes ! 
- 👀 
- 🌱 I have a project to build and app and AI advancements are making it maybe possible for me to build my own ! So I am looking to get a bit of knowledge around programming in general so I can navigate this new world. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn with the community and maybe find people that will want to help me learn and grow in this journey ! 

Thanks !
